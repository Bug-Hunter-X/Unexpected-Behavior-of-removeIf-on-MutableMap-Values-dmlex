This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Kotlin related to the `removeIf` function when used with the values of a `MutableMap`. The `removeIf` function, when applied to a list, removes elements in place, but its behavior is different when applied to the values of a map.  The example code shows that it doesn't modify the map itself, leading to unexpected results if the developer expects in-place modification.
